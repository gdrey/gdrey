  <p> Until two hours before my arrival, I did not know where I was going. I had slept for many hours on the train from Chandigarh from Allahabad and knew only to detrain in Allahabad and find the bus station to make it to Varanasi before nightfall. But as the train pulled into Allahabad, the sun was setting and darkness was descending on the city faster than I could keep up. But I had determined in my mind to arrive in Varanasi by the night and so I pursued the bus station as if it were light.</p>

  <p> Disembarking, the city was abuzz with action and the floors covered with people sleeping, their bags and trunks piled high behind them. I have admired in India people are able to sleep anywhere. Though many have no other choice but to sleep on the floor, or out on the streets, their presence has surely molded the now normalized act of sleeping on the floor with but a towel.</p>
