BENARAS, INDIA

MAY 16 – MAY 19

Until two hours before my arrival, I did not know where I was going. I had slept for many hours on the train from Chandigarh from Allahabad and knew only to detrain in Allahabad and find the bus station to make it to Varanasi before nightfall. But as the train pulled into Allahabad, the sun was setting and darkness was descending on the city faster than I could keep up. But I had determined in my mind to arrive in Varanasi by the night and so I pursued the bus station as if it were light.

Disembarking, the city was abuzz with action and the floors covered with people sleeping, their bags and trunks piled high behind them. I have admired in India people are able to sleep anywhere. Though many have no other choice but to sleep on the floor, or out on the streets, their presence has surely molded the now normalized act of sleeping on the floor with but a towel.

The streets of Indian cities are chaotic, as I have mentioned before, but the streets of Allahabad made Delhi seem calm. My bicycle rickshaw was jolted by other cyclists and bumped bumpers with the rickshaw in front of us every time we moved forward. My mind focused on the bus station and amidst the incessant beeping and honking and yelling of the streets, I was interrupted by a song.

It came over the city and blanketed its every corner, suffocating whole the sounds of the street. The song was foreign, but familiar. I could not see the man singing the song, but he seemed to be many kilometers and many centuries away. His voice followed the rickshaw as the driver maneuvered it through the street’s maze and when the bicycle again was jolted, it became clear to me. Above the movement and the changes of the street, the call to prayer was steady.

A rich voice, it beckoned to its listeners, promising to fulfill all. It answered every question and asked not one in return. Everyday this happened, the call to prayer, at the same time. In a world of inconsistency and of anomaly, the song was confident in the future and did not confuse. It originated from a place of cleanliness amid the dirty, a place of calm amid the chaos, a place of consistency amid unpredictability. Finally, in Allahabad, I understood what I had thought without confirmation: The mosque, and organized religion for that matter, removes one from the real world in order to find and give reason to their lives. Its attraction became a logical and explainable phenomenon and this was not a new, but revised thought for me.

I reached the bus stop and listened. Like in Mexico where one does not truly speak Spanish until they can understand what the sellers at the marketplace are exclaiming in words a-mile-a-minute, in India, one does not truly take buses until they can understand what the bus drivers are shouting in Hindi. Before each bus leaves, a man will walk around the bus and down the lane of traffic shouting the bus’ destination to attract more customers. I was one of those customers. Somewhere in the shouts of places I have never heard of, I recognized Banaras, the traditional name for the old city of Varanasi.

The bus ride, a nearly three-hour journey on roads surprisingly not washed away by the rains, was rocky. I had tried to reach out on Couchsurfing before arriving, but received no responses in time. In the nick of time, I remembered a conversation I had at the conference about my travels. I did not know B, a girl from the MUNCafe team, well, but recalled she had put me in touch with a friend of hers who attended university in Varanasi at the esteemed Banaras Hindu University. We had spoken, in fact, many days earlier, while I was still at the conference. We had resolved that our dates would not work out and ended on deciding with shameless naiveté to meet upon my next visit to India or his coming to the United States.

But I sent him a text message anyway for perhaps he knew of someone who had the time and the interest in hosting me for the night, which would be in 2 hours. It was a last resort and the message went along the lines of, “Hey man! I won’t be able to make it after the 20th unfortunately because I’ll be headed south. Actually, I’ll be in Varanasi in about 2 hours for two days. If you know of someone there who wants to host meet me, let me know. It’s unfortunate our dates didn’t work out because it would have been great to meet.”

Over the course of the next thirty minutes, he reached out to several of his university friends on my behalf. Thirty minutes later he found a place and in the hour following, I was sitting on the back of his friend’s Vespa headed towards the university dorms (called hostels). Upon meeting A, S’s friend, for the first time, I expressed my gratitude for his willingness to help me out, especially on such short notice, to which he responded, “There is no need to say more. A friend of S is a friend of mine.” It is into this kindness of strangers I have fallen throughout the years.

A student of law, A and his hostel-mates work hard and are varied, but teeming character and personality. This character is matched in the architecture and function of the dorm building. It seemed to better fit Dad’s explanation of his dorms than mine. The rooms are simple: two beds, two closets, two desks, and one ceiling fan. Doors remain open throughout the day and the night and a constant flow of friends and mates in and out of the room keeps the atmosphere moving even as the air remains stagnant. The hostels are entirely divided by gender, so there were only guys in all rooms and on all floors. Clothes dry in the brutal sun on wires, which crisscross the pillars making up the courtyard. The walls are dirty due, but have acquired many paintings and doodles and handprints reminiscent of Cuevo de las Manos in Argentina. The bathrooms are decrepit, but functional and no one seems to be complaining. In these dorms, one cannot be reclusive. Interaction is organic and compounded, creates a sense of camaraderie between the hostel-mates I have neither witnessed nor experienced throughout my year living on campus the University of Florida. The dorms are grungy, but so are the students. They are rife with character, but so are the students.

Varanasi is a city without time. Walking along Assi Ghat, one of the main temples beside the historical, mammoth, religious river that winds its way through India and Bangladesh, I could have easily been in the year 500 or now or 2500. Looking over the Ganges, time lost its significance. The only indications of my time were the advertisements for guesthouses painted onto the centuries old stone. In Hindi, English, Korean and Hebrew, I felt strangely comfortable reading most of the signage along the Ganges. Signs for Pesach Seder and for authentic Kimchi seemed out of place, but strangely familiar and fitting for me to be reading.

The concept of time or lack thereof permeates through all activity. We awoke lazily and meandered through the courtyard or lay awake, but still, on the beds, which are not more than a thin mattress on a wooden frame. Hostel-mates would come in and out of the room to hop on the bed or rest on the chair and to talk to R and S and me. This never happened in my dorm at the University of Florida and I cannot emphasize how much I appreciated the openness the hostel allowed and the openness of the students to guests in their space.

I recall the Metamorphosis Design Challenge I participated in throughout last semester. As part of the University of Florida’s push for pre-eminence, the Residential Housing and Education Department is reassessing the needs of buildings and campus life. The design and programming of the on-campus housing facilities were discussed in detail. The layout of the rooms, the Living-Learning-Communities (LLC) where students are placed together based on their major or interest and the specific desire to build community were all addressed. I was comfortable in the dorms for I was wholly satisfied with the bed and the kitchen. However I could not identify my larger discomfort with the dorm and residential life. I realize now it was the emptiness and silence of the halls and the lounges and the kitchen space. Everyone wanted a sense of community to form in the dorms, but communities are not formed behind locked doors and in silent corridors.

Eventually, someone would suggest we go to the street to get chai (tea) and idli, to which everyone would agree and the group would move from the crowded room to the crowded street. The chai man maintains a simple set-up: a small kettle with chai, a pot of frothing milk, a mud fireplace heating hot stones, several bags of biscuits and two benches for customers to sit. For five rupees, he will pour a cup of chai into a Dixie cup or a similar sized single-use clay cup. It is wonderfully refreshing to have in the morning and I can foresee the habit weaving itself into my morning coffee regimen upon my return to the US. Zira, prepackaged puff pastries, are dipped into the chai to absorb the tea and melt in your mouth. Idli is another breakfast staple, constituting of a light bread soaked in a mix of ground pulses with potato, onions and masala (spices). Around half past ten, after we’d returned from chai, I would depart for the day, unable to “relax” anymore and itching to see the city.

I walked many miles through Varanasi. On the banks of the Ganges, over the Ganges on temporary barges made of sheets of metal strewn on wooden planks, through many a fort such as at Ramnagar and passed many a Ghat. While walking, I was able to witness for some time, the ceremonial cremation flames on the shore. Four fires burned brightly on the sandy shores into scorching summer heat. When looking at the river above the flames, the water and the water buffalo bathing in it appeared as a mirage, glistening in the hot rays of the sun.

These cremation ceremonies have long been a tradition of Varanasi. Cremation on the banks of the river is quite expensive and even on the shoreline there are distinctions for class and wealth. Higher up, on a cement encirclement, the wealthiest pay to be burnt. The poor are cremated closer to the shore, on the sand and in the direct heat. Interestingly, wealthy Hindus from the larger cities often donate the wood used in these ceremonies, reducing the cost of cremation for the middle class. For the widows and orphans, children and other pure beings, their bodies are attached to weights and dropped into the middle of the Mother Ganges. For they are already pure, cremation is unnecessary.

The Kashi (an alternate name for Varanasi) Vishnawath Temple is where Lord Shiva sat. What the Kaaba and Masjid al-Haram is to Mecca and to Muslims, Vishnawath and its representation of jyotirlinga, the internal light piercing three worlds, is to Hindus. It is a place of serious and historic religiosity and devotion. I was pushed and shoved along, for the line to visit wound its way through the narrow streets surrounding the walls of the temple. Hours, it is said, can be waited to reach the holy shrine. Of the four main gates of entry, foreigners are only allowed into Gate 2. I was jostled from place to place, redirected multiple times and required to pay for my bag to be held while I explored the temple. The guards, in military dress, played hot potato with me. “Go there!” they yelled, then, “No, you can’t be here,” would say another. Back and forth and back and forth until my eyes fell on a sign, carved into the wall which read along the lines of:

Gentlemans who are not of the Hindu religion are kindly asked not to enter.

I was not permitted to carry with me my phone, so I cannot share photos, but this was a blatant rejection of the welcoming and kindness I have been the recipient of. I resolved to, since having been jostled so much, at least wait at the gate, and if told not to enter, to simply leave. I was permitted entry, finally, and suddenly, after the commotion and pushing and shoving outside the temple, was amidst the commotion and pushing and shoving within the temple. Unlike other temples, it was not a spectacular sight; it was humble. The stone structure in the center of the temple was a mess of flowers and milk, sweets and gifts. At the end of the tour, the guards asked me, congenially, if I was Christian or Hindu, to which I responded neither. Main Yehudi he. I am Jewish. Whether or not this was the cause of what happened next I do not know and perhaps will never know. My arm was taken and I was, again cordially, shown towards the gate.

I left Varanasi two notes. To P, a student with whom I fell into deep conversations far into the night and even into the wee hours of the morning of development in India, world politics and the value of not only travel, but immersion, I left my copy of “Guns, Germs, and Steel” by Jared Diamond. Inscribed in the cover, I told him to read the book to derive a better understanding of why countries and peoples are existent in their forms today. To A, I left my copy of “Longitudes and Attitudes,” a compilation of Thomas Friedman’s columns in the months prior to 9/11 and several years following. I directed him particularly to his writings on his visit to India for what Thomas Friedman wrote of India was accurate, refreshing and still very much pertinent. Messy as it may be, India is a democracy. It is a beacon, though with deep-rooted issues, for countries who wish to thrive in multiculturalism and in freedom. Juxtaposed in writing and physically close, Pakistan provides a stark reminder of what India has accomplished. Brilliant students, they impressed upon me a sense of authenticity, genuineness and sincerity I have not felt in others around my age.

I left Varanasi on two notes: impressed by my welcome and with a refreshed retrospective view on my experience at university thus far.
